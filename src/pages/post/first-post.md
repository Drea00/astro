  <P>
  Kendrick Lamar closed 2025 dominating Billboard's year-end R&B/Hip-Hop charts, with "Luther" (feat. SZA) leading the pack and securing the top four rap songs overall. GNX propelled this success, blending his signature storytelling with infectious beats that held strong from late 2024 into October. As the second most-searched person globally and top rapper, Lamar's album mastery, fresh off Australia tour highs,cements his status as hip-hop's commercial and lyrical powerhouse.
