  Kendrick Lamar's explosive diss track "Not Like Us" has been named Apple Music's most-streamed rap song of 2025, marking the first time a rap track has claimed the overall top spot on the platform. Released amid his high-profile feud, the song's infectious West Coast bounce and razor-sharp lyrics propelled it to billions of streams worldwide. This milestone caps a banner year for Lamar, proving his ability to turn cultural moments into enduring anthems that resonate far beyond hip-hop circles.
